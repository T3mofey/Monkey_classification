        "В результате проделанной работы можно сделать вывод, что виды cebuella pygmea и cebus capucinus наиболее трудно определимы и, предположительно дело в том, что они визуально достаточно похожи. Модель логистической регрессии справилась не лучше случайного угадывания вида, что является неудовлетворительным результатом. Это может быть связано с тем, что данная модель хороша, когда признаки явно различимы, то есть не являются сложными как в нашем случае. Лучше результаты показал transfer learning, а также svm, случайный лес  и бустинг на представлениях.  Для разных моделей подход с feature extraction оказался самым продуктивным."
